    "description": "You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You start at the first index of the array and you can jump at most k indices forward in the array. Your goal is to reach the last index and calculate the maximum score you can obtain. The score is defined as the sum of the values of the elements you land on during your jumps, including the starting and ending indices. You need to return the maximum score you can achieve.",
