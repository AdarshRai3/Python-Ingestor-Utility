    "description": "Given two integers left and right, return the abbreviated product of all integers in the range [left, right], where the product is represented in scientific notation format. The result should be formatted as a string in the form of 'd.ddde+ee', which indicates the prefix d.ddd and exponent e, with the first digit of the mantissa consisting of a single non-zero digit. If the product is zero, the output should be '0e+0'.",
