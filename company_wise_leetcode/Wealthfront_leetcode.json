    "title": "Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II",
    "description": "Given two strings s1 and s2, return the minimum number of steps required to make s1 and s2 anagrams of each other. In a single step, you can delete either one character from s1 or s2. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. Thus, to turn the strings into anagrams, you may need to delete extra characters from both strings.",
