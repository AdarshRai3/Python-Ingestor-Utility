    "title": "Score After Flipping Matrix",
    "description": "You are given a binary matrix of size m x n. You can flip the elements of any row or any column, which means changing all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s in that row or column. After making any number of flips, you want to determine the maximum possible score of the matrix. The score of the matrix is defined as the sum of the integers in each row when viewed as binary numbers. Find the maximum score you can achieve.",

        "explanation": "After flipping the first and second row, the matrix becomes [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,0]]. The binary numbers are 6, 2, and 6. Their sum is 6 + 2 + 6 = 14."
