A subset of `nums` is considered 'good' if it contains only elements that are pairwise coprime, meaning that for any two integers a and b in the subset, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is 1. Your task is to find the total number of good subsets of the array. Note that the empty subset is not counted as a good subset.",
