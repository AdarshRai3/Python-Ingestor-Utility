The water trapped over a bar is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights of the bars to its left and right, minus the height of the bar itself.",

    "description": "Given a string s consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b', you need to make the string balanced. A string is considered balanced if the number of 'a's is equal to the number of 'b's. You can achieve this by deleting some characters from the string. Your task is to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string balanced.",
