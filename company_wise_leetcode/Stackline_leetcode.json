    "title": "Minimum Height Trees",
    "description": "A tree is a connected, acyclic graph. A minimum height tree (MHT) is a tree that has the smallest height among all trees that can be formed with a given set of edges. Given a number of nodes n and a list of edges, your task is to find all the possible roots of minimum height trees. If there are multiple roots, return them all in ascending order.",

    "input_format": "An integer n representing the number of nodes (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4) and a list of edges where each edge is a list of two integers [u, v].",
    "output_format": "A list of integers representing the roots of the minimum height trees, sorted in ascending order.",

        "input": "n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]",
        "output": "[1]",
        "explanation": "Node 1 is the root of the minimum height tree as it connects to all other nodes directly."

        "output": "[3, 4]",
        "explanation": "Nodes 3 and 4 are roots of minimum height trees because they provide the shortest path to all other nodes."
