    "title": "Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value",
    "description": "Given an integer 'n' representing a numeric value and an integer 'k' representing the length of the desired string, return the lexicographically smallest string of length 'k' such that the sum of its character values (where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26) equals 'n'. If it is not possible to form such a string, return an empty string.",
