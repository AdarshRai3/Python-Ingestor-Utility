    "description": "You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. However, you can buy and sell the stock multiple times (i.e., you can sell the stock and buy it again on different days). Note that you cannot engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Return the maximum profit you can achieve.",
