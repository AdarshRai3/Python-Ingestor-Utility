    "description": "You are given a string s and an array of shifts where shifts[i] indicates the number of positions to shift the character at index i in the string s. Each shift operation can be understood as shifting the letter forward in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning when necessary. Your task is to apply all the shifts in order and return the resulting string after all shifts have been performed.",
